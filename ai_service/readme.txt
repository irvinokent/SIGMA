The contents of this ai_service folder
is sourced from the previous smaller project.
Definetely things need to be trimmed
and fixed as the bigger project is being developed.
Be sure to remove this readme.txt
when this folder has been taken care of.

Also, I honestly think that this entire folder
requires modernization.
Having to install very specific versions of packages,
including the Python itself, and even setting up
virtual environments...
This whole mess will hit our leg in the long run.
